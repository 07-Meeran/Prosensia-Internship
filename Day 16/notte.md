ðŸ”° Task: Shape Drawing Simulator (Polymorphism & Virtual Functions)

This program demonstrates **runtime polymorphism** using a `Shape` base class and its derived types:
- `Circle`
- `Rectangle`
- `Triangle`

ðŸ’¡ What It Covers
- Virtual functions
- Function overriding
- Base class pointers calling derived class methods
- Dynamic memory allocation and cleanup

ðŸ“¥ Output Example

--- Shape Drawing ---
Drawing a Circle.
Drawing a Rectangle.
Drawing a Triangle.
