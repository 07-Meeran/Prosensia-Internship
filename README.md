# Prosensia Internship Tasks  
A collection of C++ programs submitted as part of my internship onboarding.

#Day 1 Tasks:

1.cpp - Hello World
A minimal C++ program to verify the development environment.
Key Concept: Basic program structure and output.

2.cpp - Age Input
Captures user input (age) and displays it back.
Key Concept: Variable declaration and cin/cout usage.

3.cpp - Student Information System
Takes multiple inputs (name, age, GPA) and formats the output.
Key Concept: Handling mixed data types (string, int, float).

#Day 2 Tasks:

Take input of marks for 3 subjects:
  - Mathematics
  - English
  - Physics
- Each subject has a maximum of **100 marks**
- Calculate:
  - **Total marks** out of 300
  - **Average percentage**
  - **Grade** based on the following criteria:

| Grade | Average (%)    |
|-------|----------------|
| A     | 80 â€“ 100       |
| B     | 70 â€“ 79        |
| C     | 60 â€“ 69        |
| Fail  | Less than 60   |

ðŸ’» Sample Output
Enter your marks in given subjects (Each subject has 100 marks)
Enter obtained marks in Mathematics:
85
Enter obtained marks in English:
74
Enter obtained marks in Physics:
90
Total Marks = 249/300
Average = 83%
Grade: A

#Day 3 Task:

ðŸ“Œ Task: Eligibility Checker

This program takes user input for:

-Name
-Age
-CGPA

It then checks if the user is eligible to apply (Age â‰¥ 18 **and** CGPA â‰¥ 2.5) and prints a custom message using `if/else` statements.

##Day 4 Tasks:

ðŸ“Œ Task Overview

Todayâ€™s task focused on:

Practicing loops (for, while)
Reversing a number
Checking if a number is prime
ðŸ“„ Programs Included

Reverse a Number

Input: Any integer
Output: Reversed digits
Loop Used: while and for (alternative)
Prime Number Checker

Input: Any integer
Output: Tells whether it is prime or not
Loop Used: for

##Day 5 Tasks
ðŸ’» ProSensia C++ Internship â€“ Day 5

ðŸ“Œ Task Title: Function Logic â€“ Factorial & Max of Three

Todayâ€™s task focuses on modular programming using user-defined functions in C++.

âœ… What This Code Does

Calculates the factorial of a user-entered number using a factorial() function.
Determines the maximum of three integers using a maxOfThree() function.
ðŸ”§ Concepts Used

Function declarations and definitions
Parameters and return types
Local variables and scope
Edge case handling (e.g., negative factorial input)
ðŸ’» Sample Output

Enter a number to find factorial: 5 Factorial of 5 is 120

Enter three integers to find the maximum: 11 9 27 The maximum number is: 27

#Day 6 
ðŸ’» ProSensia C++ Internship â€“ Day 6

ðŸ“Œ Task: Intelligent Array Analyzer

This simple C++ program performs the following:
- Takes input of **5 integers**
- Calculates:
  - âœ… Sum of all numbers
  - âœ… Average (2 decimal places)
  - âœ… Maximum and minimum values with their positions (1-based)
- Reorders the array to show:
  - âœ… Even numbers first, then odd numbers
  - âœ… Original order preserved in both sections

  ðŸ’» ProSensia C++ Internship â€“ Day 7

ðŸ“Œ Task: String Manipulator â€“ Reverse, Vowel Filter & Palindrome Check

This beginner-friendly C++ program takes a *single word (no spaces or symbols)* and performs:

- âœ… Converts string to lowercase manually
- âœ… Reverses string (no built-in functions)
- âœ… Checks for palindrome using index-based comparison
- âœ… Counts vowels (ignores repeated vowels like "coool" â†’ 1 vowel)
- âœ… Rejects input with spaces or symbols

ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
- How to work with strings character by character
- Writing small, useful functions (modularity)
- Validating user input without built-in libraries
- Logic for skipping repeated vowels

ðŸ“¥ Sample Input
Enter a single word (no spaces or symbols): Hello

ðŸ“¥Sample Output
String Analysis --- 
Original string  : hello 
Reversed string  : olleh 
String length    : 5 
Vowel count      : 2 
Is Palindrome?   : NO
