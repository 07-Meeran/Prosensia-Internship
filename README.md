# Prosensia Internship Tasks  
A collection of C++ programs submitted as part of my internship onboarding.

#Day 1 Tasks:

1.cpp - Hello World
A minimal C++ program to verify the development environment.
Key Concept: Basic program structure and output.

2.cpp - Age Input
Captures user input (age) and displays it back.
Key Concept: Variable declaration and cin/cout usage.

3.cpp - Student Information System
Takes multiple inputs (name, age, GPA) and formats the output.
Key Concept: Handling mixed data types (string, int, float).

#Day 2 Tasks:

Take input of marks for 3 subjects:
  - Mathematics
  - English
  - Physics
- Each subject has a maximum of **100 marks**
- Calculate:
  - **Total marks** out of 300
  - **Average percentage**
  - **Grade** based on the following criteria:

| Grade | Average (%)    |
|-------|----------------|
| A     | 80 – 100       |
| B     | 70 – 79        |
| C     | 60 – 69        |
| Fail  | Less than 60   |

💻 Sample Output
Enter your marks in given subjects (Each subject has 100 marks)
Enter obtained marks in Mathematics:
85
Enter obtained marks in English:
74
Enter obtained marks in Physics:
90
Total Marks = 249/300
Average = 83%
Grade: A

#Day 3 Task:

📌 Task: Eligibility Checker

This program takes user input for:

-Name
-Age
-CGPA

It then checks if the user is eligible to apply (Age ≥ 18 **and** CGPA ≥ 2.5) and prints a custom message using `if/else` statements.
