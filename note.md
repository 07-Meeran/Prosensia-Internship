🔰 Topic: Inheritance and Reusability in OOP
This program demonstrates:
- Single and multi-level inheritance
- Virtual function and overriding
- Object management using base class pointers

👨‍💻 Classes
- `Employee` (Base Class): name, ID, salary
- `Manager` (Derived): adds bonus
- `Developer` (Derived): adds programming language

🎯 Features
- Polymorphic `display()` function
- Base class pointer holding different derived class objects
- Demonstrates function overriding and virtual dispatch
