💻 ProSensia C++ Internship – Day 8

## 📌 Task: Pointer Labyrinth – Conditional Swapping & Array Traversal

This C++ program uses **pointers** to:
- Swap two values **only if their difference > 10**
- Print array values with their **memory addresses**
- Increment **odd numbers** in the array using address manipulation
- Find the **first even element** (pointer return)
- Bonus: Count values greater than a reference value

## 📥 Sample Input
Enter two integers (a and b): 5 20

Enter 5 integers:
1 3 4 6 7

## 📤 Sample Output
🔁 Checking Conditional Swap:
Swapped because difference > 10.
a = 20, b = 5

🔹 Array Values and Memory Addresses:
Value: 1 Address: 0x...
Value: 3 Address: 0x...

🔼 Array after incrementing odd values by 1:
Value: 2 Address: 0x...
Value: 4 Address: 0x...

✅ First even element: 2 at address 0x...

🔢 Numbers greater than a (20): 0
