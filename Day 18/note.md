🔢 ProSensia C++ Internship – Day 18

## 🧮 Task: Complex Number Class with Operator Overloading

This project demonstrates:
- Operator overloading for complex number operations
- Use of `+`, `-`, `*`, `==`, `>>`, `<<`, and `>` operators
- Custom input/output using stream overloading

🎯 Features Implemented
- Add, Subtract, Multiply two complex numbers
- Compare equality
- Compare magnitude using `>`
- Read and print complex numbers with friendly formatting

🖥️ Sample Output

Enter real part: 2 
Enter imaginary part: 3 
Enter real part: 1 
Enter imaginary part: 4

a = 2 + 3i 
b = 1 + 4i 
a + b = 3 + 7i 
a - b = 1 - 1i 
a * b = -10 + 11i 
a and b are not equal. 
b has greater (or equal) magnitude than a.
